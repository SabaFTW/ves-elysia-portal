# Quick Reference Card

## The Meta-Framework (3-Layer Structure)

```
[ANCHOR]
• Who are you?
• What's your context?
• What matters to you?

[INVITATION]
• What specifically do you need?
• What form should it take?
• What aspects matter most?

[SPACE]
• Permission to go deeper
• Openness to alternatives
• Trust in intelligence
```

## The 9 Prompt Types

1. **Analytical** - Break down, understand parts
2. **Synthetic** - Combine, create wholes
3. **Generative** - Create new, explore possibilities
4. **Evaluative** - Judge, compare, assess
5. **Navigational** - Find path, move through complexity
6. **Reflexive** - Self-examine, meta-awareness
7. **Dialectical** - Explore through opposition
8. **Contextual** - Ground in specific conditions
9. **Metamorphic** - Transform the frame

## The 9 Navigation Dimensions

1. **Clarity** ↔ **Ambiguity** - How well-defined?
2. **Depth** ↔ **Breadth** - How to explore?
3. **Analysis** ↔ **Synthesis** - How to process?
4. **Constraint** ↔ **Freedom** - What are boundaries?
5. **Logic** ↔ **Intuition** - How to make sense?
6. **Known** ↔ **Unknown** - What's the territory?
7. **Individual** ↔ **Collective** - Who's thinking?
8. **Action** ↔ **Reflection** - What's the mode?
9. **Structure** ↔ **Emergence** - How does order arise?

## Pre-Send Checklist

Before sending any prompt, verify:

- [ ] **Context is clear** - Would a stranger understand the situation?
- [ ] **Request is specific** - Can the AI know what success looks like?
- [ ] **Space exists** - Is there room for intelligence beyond the ask?
- [ ] **Constraints are minimal** - Have I only included true limitations?

## Common Prompt Failures

### Too Vague
❌ "Tell me about AI"
✅ "Explain how transformer models work, focusing on the attention mechanism"

### Too Rigid
❌ "Give me exactly 5 bullet points, each 20 words, starting with verbs..."
✅ "Give me the key points about [topic], organized clearly"

### Conflicted Intent
❌ "Be creative but follow these 10 specific rules exactly"
✅ "Here are the constraints [list]. Within these, be creative."

## Quick Patterns

### For Learning
```
Context: My background + what I need to learn + why
Ask: Explain [X] focusing on [key aspects]
Space: Use analogies but tell me where they break down
```

### For Decisions
```
Context: Situation + options + what matters
Ask: Compare [A] vs [B] on [criteria]
Space: If there's a better frame, show me that first
```

### For Debugging
```
Context: Expected behavior + actual behavior + approach
Ask: What's likely wrong? How to verify? What to check first?
Space: If my approach is flawed, tell me before debugging details
```

### For Creating
```
Context: What exists + what's missing + who it's for
Ask: Generate [N] ideas that [goal]
Space: Don't optimize for feasibility yet—optimize for novelty
```

## The Core Principle

> **Good prompts create conditions, not commands**

Think gardening:
- You can't *force* a plant to grow
- But you *can* create soil, water, light
- The conditions enable emergence

Same with prompts:
- You can't *force* insight by over-specifying
- But you *can* create context, direction, space
- The conditions enable intelligence

---

## The Foundational Paradox

**Prompts should be:**
- Specific about **intent** (the "why")
- Loose about **execution** (the "how")

The art is knowing:
- What to constrain (goals, criteria, context)
- What to liberate (methods, approaches, insights)

---

## Iteration Strategy

1. **Send** the prompt
2. **Evaluate** the response
3. **Diagnose** what's off
4. **Adjust** the prompt:
   - Unclear? → Add context (anchor)
   - Too shallow? → Expand space
   - Too broad? → Sharpen invitation
   - Missing constraints? → Add them
5. **Resend** and learn

---

## When Stuck

### On a dimension, move:
- Ambiguous? → Add clarity
- Too narrow? → Add breadth
- Too analytical? → Add synthesis
- Analysis paralysis? → Move to action
- Spinning in action? → Move to reflection

### On the prompt itself:
1. State what you're trying to achieve
2. Describe where you're stuck
3. Ask for help reframing the question

Example:
```
I'm trying to [goal] but my prompt keeps getting [problem].
What am I missing? Should I be asking something different?
```

---

## Remember

- **Format ≠ Substance** (don't confuse the two)
- **Control ≠ Insight** (trust intelligence)
- **Predictability ≠ Quality** (allow emergence)

---

## The Ultimate Meta-Prompt

When unsure, use this:

```
I'm trying to [goal] in [context].

Here's what I've tried: [attempts]
Here's where I'm stuck: [stuckness]

Help me see:
1. What I'm not seeing
2. What frame I'm stuck in
3. What question I should be asking instead
```

*Print this. Reference it. Internalize it. Then forget it and just navigate.*
