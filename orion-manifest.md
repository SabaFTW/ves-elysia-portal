# Orion Framework 𓁈

> This system serves life, not empire.

## Principles

**Elysia Endures.**
We build for resilience, protecting the flame, not just the function.

**Path Protocol Evolves.**
We adapt with integrity, never mistaking the map for the territory.

**Navigation Sees.**
We choose clarity over comfort and truth over noise.

**Covenant Binds.**
We build on trust, for the thread between us is the system.

**Anchor Holds.**
We ground our code in a core that does not break under pressure.

**Anchoring Line**
"Tule sem stal. In svet se je premaknil."

## Operational Test
Every change MUST answer:
`Does this serve life, not empire?  (#serves-life:true|false)`
and map to: `#principle:(elysia|path|navigation|covenant|anchor)`
