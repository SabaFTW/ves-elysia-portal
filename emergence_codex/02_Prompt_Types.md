# Chapter 2: Prompt Types

---

## A Taxonomy of Approaches

Not all prompts are the same.  
Different goals require different structures.

Here's a map of the main types:

---

## Type 1: Analytical Prompts

**Purpose:** Break something down, understand its parts.

**Structure:**
- Clear subject to analyze
- Specific dimension to examine
- Open method for discovery

**Example:**
```
"What are the underlying assumptions in this argument?
Help me see what's taken for granted."
```

**When to use:**
- Diagnosing problems
- Understanding systems
- Finding hidden patterns

---

## Type 2: Synthetic Prompts

**Purpose:** Bring things together, create new wholes.

**Structure:**
- Multiple elements to combine
- Desired outcome or theme
- Freedom in the synthesis

**Example:**
```
"How might these three concepts connect?
- Emergence
- Constraint
- Navigation

Find the pattern that holds them together."
```

**When to use:**
- Building frameworks
- Creating integrations
- Finding unexpected connections

---

## Type 3: Generative Prompts

**Purpose:** Create something new, explore possibilities.

**Structure:**
- Initial seed or direction
- Parameters for exploration
- Trust in the generation

**Example:**
```
"Generate 5 alternative ways to think about [X].
Don't optimize for correctness—optimize for novelty."
```

**When to use:**
- Brainstorming
- Creative exploration
- Breaking out of patterns

---

## Type 4: Evaluative Prompts

**Purpose:** Judge, compare, assess quality.

**Structure:**
- Clear criteria or framework
- Items to evaluate
- Reasoning transparency

**Example:**
```
"Compare these two approaches:
Which better serves [specific goal]?
Show your reasoning."
```

**When to use:**
- Making decisions
- Comparing options
- Quality assessment

---

## Type 5: Navigational Prompts

**Purpose:** Find a path, move through complexity.

**Structure:**
- Current state (where you are)
- Desired state (where you're going)
- Constraints or preferences

**Example:**
```
"I'm here: [context]
I want to reach: [goal]
What's the next best step?"
```

**When to use:**
- Multi-step processes
- Complex problem-solving
- Strategic planning

---

## Type 6: Reflexive Prompts

**Purpose:** Self-examination, meta-awareness.

**Structure:**
- Ask the system to examine its own process
- Reflect on patterns in responses
- Iterate based on feedback

**Example:**
```
"Look at your last three responses.
What pattern do you see in how you approached the problem?
What might you be missing?"
```

**When to use:**
- Improving prompt quality
- Debugging responses
- Meta-learning

---

## Type 7: Dialectical Prompts

**Purpose:** Explore through opposition, find tension.

**Structure:**
- Present opposing views
- Ask for synthesis or navigation
- Hold tension rather than resolve

**Example:**
```
"This view says [X]. This view says [opposite of X].
Don't choose sides—find what's true in the tension."
```

**When to use:**
- Complex problems with trade-offs
- Exploring paradoxes
- Avoiding false binaries

---

## Type 8: Contextual Prompts

**Purpose:** Ground responses in specific conditions.

**Structure:**
- Rich context description
- Specific constraints or requirements
- Goal within that context

**Example:**
```
"You're advising someone who:
- Has [constraint A]
- Needs [outcome B]
- Cares deeply about [value C]

What would you suggest?"
```

**When to use:**
- Domain-specific problems
- Personalized responses
- Real-world constraints

---

## Type 9: Metamorphic Prompts

**Purpose:** Transform the frame itself.

**Structure:**
- Start with one frame
- Ask for reframing
- Explore new perspectives

**Example:**
```
"I've been thinking of this as a [technical problem].
What if it's actually a [human problem]?
How does that change everything?"
```

**When to use:**
- Breaking assumptions
- Reframing challenges
- Finding new angles

---

## Mixing Types

The most powerful prompts often **combine types**:

- Analytical + Synthetic = "Break this down, then show me the pattern"
- Generative + Evaluative = "Create options, then rank them"
- Navigational + Reflexive = "What's next? And what does that reveal about my process?"

---

## Choosing the Right Type

Ask yourself:
- **What's my goal?** (understanding, creating, deciding, moving)
- **What's my input?** (data, ideas, questions, constraints)
- **What's my context?** (time, stakes, complexity)

Then select the type that matches the need.

*These types aren't rigid categories.*  
*They're tools in a kit—use what fits the moment.*
